Privacy Policy

Last updated: [01-Sept-2024]

Introduction

Welcome to ClickChef! Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle the only piece of information we processâ€”the food photos you take when using our mobile application ("App").

1. Information We Collect

We do not collect any personal information such as your name, email address, phone number, or any other personally identifiable information.

The only data we process is the food photo that you take using the App.

2. How We Use Your Information

Photo Processing: When you take a food photo using the App, it is sent to OpenAI's API to generate a recipe based on the contents of the image.
Automatic Deletion: Once the recipe is generated and displayed to you, the photo is automatically deleted from our servers. We do not store any images or use them for any other purposes.
3. How We Share Your Information

We do not share your information with any third parties, except:

With OpenAI: The food photo you take is sent to OpenAI solely for the purpose of generating a recipe. OpenAI processes the image according to its own privacy policies and practices.
4. Data Security

We take the security of your data seriously. The photos are transmitted securely to OpenAI for processing, and they are deleted immediately after the recipe is generated. No photos are stored or retained on our servers after this process.

5. Your Rights

As we do not collect or store any personal data, there are no personal data rights applicable to the use of our App. The only data handled (your food photo) is deleted immediately after the recipe is provided.

6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. When we do, we will post the updated policy on this page and update the "Last updated" date at the top.
